```

> _Tip: Reference the GitHub Issue in your PR for context._

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Always link the related issue (e.g., "Closes #17").

## üîê Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables defined in a `.env` file at the root of the project.

### How it's loaded

- ‚úÖ When using Docker Compose, the `.env` file is loaded automatically via the `env_file` directive.
- ‚úÖ Inside Django, the variables are accessed using `python-decouple` (`config('SECRET_KEY')` etc).

### Hybrid Django + FastAPI Setup

This project integrates **Django** and **FastAPI** into a single ASGI application to support both traditional Django views and modern asynchronous FastAPI endpoints.

#### ASGI Application Structure

- `core/asgi.py` mounts both apps using `Starlette`'s `Mount` routing:
  - Django app is mounted at `/`
  - FastAPI app is mounted at `/api/fastapi`

#### Running Locally

```bash
uvicorn core.asgi:application --reload
```


### Elasticsearch Integration

This project integrates Django with Elasticsearch to provide powerful search and filtering capabilities.

üöÄ Technologies:
Django: The core web framework.
Elasticsearch: The search and analytics engine.
django-elasticsearch-dsl & django-elasticsearch-dsl-drf: Libraries for seamless Elasticsearch integration with Django.
drf-spectacular: Tool for automatic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).

üíª Getting Started:
This guide will get your local development environment up and running.

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Docker installed to run Elasticsearch locally.
1. Run Elasticsearch: Start the Elasticsearch container using Docker Compose.
```
docker-compose up -d elasticsearch
```
2. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages from your requirements.txt file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Index Data: Build your Elasticsearch indexes and sync them with your database. This is a crucial step to ensure all your data is searchable.
```
python manage.py search_index --rebuild
```
4. Run the Django Server: Start the development server to access the API.
```
python manage.py runserver
```

üîç API Endpoints:
All API endpoints now support advanced search and filtering via Elasticsearch.

API Documentation:
Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation are automatically generated for all endpoints.
- Swagger UI: /api/schema/swagger-ui/
- ReDoc: /api/schema/redoc/

Startups Endpoint:
- URL: /api/startups/
- Method: GET
Description: Perform full-text search, filtering, and ordering on startup data.

Query Parameters:
- search or q: Full-text keyword to match in company_name and description.
- industries.name: Filters by industry name (e.g., Fintech).
- location.country: Filters by the country (e.g., USA).
- funding_stage: Filters by funding stage (e.g., Seed, Series A).
- ordering: Sorts results. Use a minus sign for descending order (e.g., -funding_stage).

Example:
```
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/startups/?search=ai&funding_stage=seed&ordering=-funding_stage"
```

Projects Endpoint:
- URL: /api/projects/
- Method: GET
Description: Search and filter project data.

Query Parameters:
- search or q: Full-text keyword to match in title and description.
- category.name: Filters by the project's category name.
- startup.company_name: Filters by the name of the associated startup.

Example:
```
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/projects/?search=solar&category.name=Tech"
```

# OAuth Authentication Setup

This project supports authentication using **OAuth providers** (**Google** and **GitHub**).

## üîπ Google OAuth Setup

### Create Google OAuth Credentials
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one).
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials**.
4. Click **Create Credentials ‚Üí OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
5. If prompted, configure the consent screen.
6. Add **Authorized Redirect URIs**:  `http://yourdomain.com/oauth/callback/`(example)
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Environment Variables
Add the following to `.env` file:

```text
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```
## üîπ GitHub OAuth Setup

### Create GitHub OAuth App
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Click **New OAuth App**.
3. Fill in application details.
4. Set **Authorization Callback URL**:  `http://yourdomain.com/oauth/callback/`
5. Copy the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**.

### Environment Variables
Add these to `.env` file:

```text
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

## üîê Authentication Flow

### OAuth Login Process

#### Client-Side OAuth Flow
1. Frontend redirects users to **Google/GitHub OAuth consent screen**.
2. After consent, provider redirects back with **authorization code**.
3. Frontend exchanges code for **access token** using provider's token endpoint.

#### Backend Token Validation
Example request:

```http
POST api/v1/auth/oauth/login/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "provider": "google",  // or "github"
  "access_token": "oauth_provided_access_token"
}
```
#### Backend Processing
1. Validates access token with provider's API.
2. Retrieves user profile information.
3. Creates or updates local user record.
4. Issues JWT tokens for authentication(Only for users with is_active=True).

#### Response
```json
{
  "access": "jwt_access_token",
    "user": {
    "id": "user_123",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "user_phone": "",
    "title": "",
    "role": "user"
  }
}
```
### JWT Token Issuance
The system uses Django REST Framework Simple JWT for token management:
- Access Token: Short-lived (default 5 minutes) for API authentication
- Refresh Token - set in HTTP-only cookie: Longer-lived (default 24 hours) for obtaining new access tokens.
- Automatic User Creation: New users are automatically created with data from OAuth providers.
