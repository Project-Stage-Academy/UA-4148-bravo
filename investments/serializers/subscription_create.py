    Serializer for creating a new investment subscription.

    Fields:
        investor (Investor): The investor making the subscription.
        project (Project): The project to invest in.
        amount (Decimal): Investment amount, required and must be >= 0.01.

    Validation:
        - Ensures project exists and is a valid instance.
        - Ensures the requesting user is an investor.
        - Prevents self-investment (investor cannot fund their own startup project).
        - Prevents investments into fully funded projects.
        - Prevents investment amounts that exceed remaining funding.
        - Ensures amount is greater than or equal to 0.01.

    Creation:
        - Uses database transactions with row-level locking to prevent race conditions.
        - Recalculates effective funding using both DB aggregate and project's current_funding to avoid drift.
        - Updates the project's current_funding field after saving the subscription.
